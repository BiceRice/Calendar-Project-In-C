# Calendar-Project-In-C

This project prints out the calendar of a user desired year,
it will use the formual to calcualte the leap year and to
find out which day of the week does the day 0 start on a given 
year. 

The formula to calculate leap year was not created by me, instead I 
used this website:
https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html

Will try to implement to redirect the output to a text file
